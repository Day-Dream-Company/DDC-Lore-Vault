# Founding
[[WUC Archer]] is the person who came up with the idea to collect mages as magic starts to return. He would ah e been very young, and it would have accelerated his advancement in the guard. Around the time that the [[Doomed Adventurers]] were active, [[Tane Altes]] would have joined [[WUC Archer]] to look for candidates. [[Tane's Sister]] chose not to join [[WUC]] and instead wanted to forge her own path. [[Sebastian]] is the next to join, though he would not have known he had a strong aura until [[Tane Altes]] met him. After the [[Doomed Adventurers]] disaster, [[Rena]] goes to [[Tane Altes]] and joins [[WUC]] to restart her life. [[Rena]] meets [[Kuno]] and convinced her to join, and they are the main roster. Later on, [[Artis]] is found and he joins.
