# Physical Appearance
I'm switching [[Rena]] from a guy to a girl, because [[WUC]] is a sausage fest. This also means her name probably needs to change, maybe.
# Names
- Avon
- Ava
- Avoria (meh)
- Urien (or some variation)
- Rena
	- renatus means “reborn” in Latin
	- I like this one
	- Reen might be a good shortening nickname, even though it’s the same amount of letters lol
- Rien
	- Pronounced REE-en
	- gender neutral with a masculine slant, so probably not
# Clothing & Armor
## Scarf
I want her to have a scarf thing, sorts like why Marth has. Something to cover [[Rena's Amulet]], among other reasons.
