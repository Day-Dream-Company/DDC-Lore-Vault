# Name
I don't know what his name should be. It was originally Iay, but that name is unpronounceable and not great. Some options are:
- Tane
- Altes (I like this as a last name)
- Tane Altes
I think I like Tane Altes the most and I can't find any other good options, so I will switch him to that for now.
# Magic
#Summoning #Manifestation
His aura manifests as flat solid platforms in space. They appear as a soft white frosted glass surface. They are immovable and solid, but they can be broken and shattered if hit hard enough. In [[An Offer You Can't Refuse]] I describe a partial fracture, and I describe that he can "heal" his projections after they are damaged. The platforms *can not* be moved through space, though. They are locked in place, and he can manifest and dismiss them. Extending the surface of an existing platform *might* be possible, but there is very little reason to do that when you can just make more platforms.

His summoning magic is primarily limitted to classic telekinesis, and long distance portals. In order to portal somewhere he needs to know the destination well, and have reflective surfaces at both points through which to create the portal. The closer to mirror surface, the easier the portal is to create. It is not clear to me whether or not he can instantly teleport things or not. I think that if he can snap his fingers and teleport an object at will, it is very difficult for him. Kuno is the one who can do instant teleporting, and it would be more likely that she would cooperate with him and be the one to do it instead.

He is also able to use summoning to do [[Aura]] interrogation and transfer. He uses this to enable [[Kuno]] to do magic, despite her being [[Soul Locked]]. He also stores excess [[Aura]] in [[Mana Reserve]]s for use later by members of the group like [[Kuno]].
