# Name
His name is derived from the Greek words for [Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astraeus) and [Void](https://www.google.com/search?q=greek+word+for+void&sca_esv=d139cd1eb4e89a1c&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS986US986&sxsrf=ADLYWIKguK2MaRiS-j0FUd_Vcq1P2rfuWg%3A1723894610681&ei=UovAZuagKYuyptQPpveZ2AI&ved=0ahUKEwjmkZnv9_uHAxULmYkEHaZ7BisQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=greek+word+for+void&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiE2dyZWVrIHdvcmQgZm9yIHZvaWQyBBAjGCcyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgsQABiABBiRAhiKBTILEAAYgAQYkQIYigUyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgsQABiABBiRAhiKBTIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAkjuDFDPA1jgC3ABeAGQAQCYAZUBoAH9AaoBAzAuMrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCA6ACkALCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcDMS4yoAepDQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp).

# Personality
Aster is reserved and calculating, but also a little paranoid. He wishes for adventure and success, but finds it hard to get up and make those things happen for himself. He is risk averse, but finds the most success when he is pushed beyond his comfort zone by forces he cannot control. He adapts well to changing environments, but has a high effort inertia.

It's important to note that "high effort inertia" does not mean that he is not willing to put in lots of effort. He is actually often willing to put in *way more effort than is reasonable,* but only if his first attempts to problem solve his way around the issue don't work out. His first instinct is to create leverage to solve the problem easily, but the longer he spends on a problem (and he will spend a *long time,* because he can't leave something at just "good enough") the more likely he is to default over to "well this obviously just needs more power, more effort, more more more," and once he arrives at the brute force strategy he has a very hard time *stopping* that strategy. He is in for a penny, in for a pound. If he's expending effort it's because there's no other choice, and if there's no other choice then the only solution is more effort.

He strongly believes that no one ever reaches their maximum potential output and lives. Therefore, if you are still alive, you can go further, then repeat. No one knows how strong they are until strong is the only choice they have.
## Infinite Effort
[[Aster Kenos]] has some kind of mild permanent [[Aura Poisoning]] damage because he pushes magic too far fairly regularly and ends up with the very early stages of [[Aura Poisoning]]. This might make him more resistant to it in general, but only to a small degree.
### Quotes
- If you ever think “this is all I’ve got,” then you are wrong. If you can think it then you are still alive, and if you are still alive then you can push yourself a little further.
- With enough time and effort you can do anything. If you’re still alive then you have more effort to give, and with enough magical effort you can literally *make more time.* No excuses.
- Everyone dies. The only difference is whether you go out on your own terms, or someone else’s.
- You never know how strong you are until strong is the only choice you have.
# Backstory
## Magic Academy
So the current version for Aster’s backstory is that it was clear he had magical aptitude from a young age, because in DDC I would think it’s fairly common for people with magical potential to accidentally flare their aura visually in small ways even when they are not trained. Tobi is a good example of this in the extreme, where she kinda can’t help but have it come out, it’s subconscious and tied to her emotions or whatever.

(This isn’t as true in the non-magic nation, but only because of their environment. In principle it would be the same, but someone with potential would never be noticed without intentional magical observation because even the most naturally attuned people won’t have enough of an aura for it to be visible without actual training.)

Anyway, it’s obvious one way or another that he has magical aptitude as a kid, and he learns some magic on his own through trial and error. He can do basic levitation, but with direct forces. I think I’d like to make it a type of augmentation magic, but I need to talk to daz about whether or not applying forces to things is augmentation or alchemy, because it’s not very clear. The point though is that it’s not summoning, but he *thinks it is* because what else could it be. When he’s older he enrolls in the magical academy for the same reason that lots of people IRL go to college, because getting a degree is just “what you’re supposed to do” to get a good job, and he’s capable of taking that path. His heart isn’t really in it, but like what else is there to do.

When i picture the process of enrolling at the academy I imagine that basically the first thing you do is meet with one of the faculty to like verify that you can actually do magic at the bare minimum and to organize your personal curriculum and finish up all the boring administrative stuff. Aster meets with a professor who I have temporarily named Lyssa Vrendel, and she immediately picks up on the fact that Asher does not actually understand the kind of magic he can do. I don’t know exactly how that interaction goes yet, but I know he is incredulous and stubborn, and he does not like being told that he’s wrong or that he doesn’t know stuff. His magical strength and his ability to concentrate on complicated magic is impressive, but the way he uses magic is blunt, literal, inefficient, and uninspired. She puts his application or whatever on hold, and asks him to meet with her later for a more involved 1 on 1 so that they can figure out what exactly he should be doing at the academy.

Lyssa sees that he has the intuition to take elementary aspects and assemble them into more complex systems, but it isn’t clear whether he actually has the drive and inspiration to do the kind of building that she is looking for. Everything he knows is almost entirely self taught. Like he obviously heard from other people what magic is and what it’s called and that there are the 4 different types and stuff, but no one ever actually explained the mechanics to him. He was effectively *inventing* new magic from first principles, even if what he discovered is basic and not necessarily new, which makes him a potentially great candidate for Lyssa’s experimental computational magic curriculum at the academy. She just needs to figure out whether or not he is capable of seeing the vision, or if he will never be able to move past his stubbornness and will get left behind.

Obviously she gets through to him and decides that he is a good fit. They have a second conversation where she explains some stuff about how psychology affects magic, and he has his first tiny bit of realization that in order to overcome the his limitations he will have to fundamentally change the way he sees the world. She tells him that she “will not let him” enroll in the normal summoning or augmentation tracks or whatever. He is like “wtf why not,” and she says it’s because she wants him in Computational Magic instead. Initially the reason he was at the academy was because it was the straightforward and pragmatic thing to do, but now he’s being asked to invest his education in a field of magic research basically no one has heard of, which was not even a thing he was aware he could have chosen to do lol.

That’s a really really long way of saying that he had a mentor who saw the potential in him and pushed him in that direction. He didn’t show up with that inspiration already, or at least he didn’t know that was what he wanted to do. Aster has a particular flavor of magic that is his own, just like everyone does, and that just comes from who he is. That would have been true regardless of what he studied at the academy. He manipulates the fundamental forces and he tries to get them to do useful things by using them in clever ways, but that’s not really what his “field” of study actually is. Lyssa got him working on developing magic as modular parts of larger systems, where the spells not only react conditionally to different things but also interact between each other to create effects and systems that would otherwise be impossible. The entire point of the field is that they can bypass the limitations of individuals by just having a bunch of different people contribute their particular skills into the system, and then letting the system work for society overall. This type of work speaks to Aster in the same way that he refuses to be told he’s not capable of something. It has that kind of hubris he likes where it’s trying to have the best of all worlds at once.

I need to get daz to confirm this, but I imagine that the magic defensive dome in Sev’reon was like one big contiguous smooth forcefield thing when Aster was born. Like the energy forcefields the Gungans have in Star Wars, where it’s got like a central thing that emits the shield and then it just is what it is. It would have been a massive piece of ritual magic that required a ton of mages to all do the actual same magic all together, and changing the shape or behavior of it would have been a huge ordeal. I imagine there would have been specific checkpoints where there are permanent openings that need to be guarded at all times, like the dome was basically a static structure.

When Aster leaves the academy it is to go pitch his Magic Dome 2.0 concept with Lyssa’s recommendation, and the plan is to replace the shield with something more dynamic. By the time the Dark Aura events are happening the dome is now a bunch of tiled hexagonal segments, still in the same dome shape, but where each section is a modular version of roughly the same kind of shield magic, and where sections can be turned on and off. What used to require a bunch of guild wizards to all show up and spend 6 hours replacing a permanent environmental enchantment is now an array of tons of modular enchanted artifacts all plugged into a central Aura distribution network thing that almost anyone with Aura (or maybe even literally anyone) can operate. Air traffic would become more of a thing when you don’t have to land in order to get inside the city because they can just power down a section up high, checkpoints in and out of the city can be closed when there is no traffic, the dome might even have different levels of shielding that can be toggled through. It might be able to go fully physical or only block magic or not block anything but just sense things crossing it and raise an alert. He’s not literally making the hardware by hand or embedding the spells, he’s the system architect.

Aster’s “vice” is that he can’t leave things alone to just be good enough, he always wants everything to be the perfect no compromises solution. That’s what the dome is, and that’s what he sees in computational magic. With enough time and effort, and with enough types of people, you can build a series of conditional enchantments to do anything. Effort is something that he thinks people can choose to have infinite of, and while time is finite he will eventually learn how to literally convert effort into additional time lol, so those are the things he is willing to “compromise” on. It enables him to work on stuff like the dome, but it also is what keeps him in place. He procrastinates a lot, and it isn’t until “the plot” shows up and forces him to start making decisions that the dramatic things in his life start happening.

# Combat
## Initial Description
He is designed to be physically unassuming, though he should be capable of holding his own in a fight. He does not have formal or even really practical training, but his style of magic enables him to overcome his lack of skill and strength. His ability to observe and analyze is his greatest strength.
## Future Training
As he starts to get involved with dangerous characters and adventures, [[Aster Kenos]] starts to realize that he isn’t going to be able to just let his instincts and technical talent carry him for much longer. He needs to expand his combat abilities, he needs to grow stronger and more capable with the abilities he already has, and he needs to build fighting skill into instantly accessible muscle memory.
# [[Veritas Inventa]]
He runs the high fantasy equivalent of a data recovery and phone repair business. He is skilled at repairing items as well as recovering and extracting information and memories imprinted within them. He is useful for lay-people in the same way a phone repair shop at the mall is useful, but he is also useful for enterprise level work as well as some more adversarial use cases such as decryption and remote surveillance.

# Magic
#Summoning #Augmentation
He is limited to Boost and Summoning magic. His [[Aura]]'s [[Dynamic]] is a gravitational lensing effect with a bright green glowing effect. The light is often a backlight halo light when it's on him, but when pushing magic through an object the object itself will often glow. When pushed to his limit the color will increase in brightness until it appears more white than green. When his aura is extremely strong, his lensing effect might be able to be used as a form of active camouflage.

His magic is limited in range. This is a quirk of his own talent, he simply struggles to project magic across empty space. To circumvent this, he uses [[Auratech]] machines to help do magic at a distance by acting as amplifiers/repeaters. His magic machines can also function as "anchors" that allow him to know their location and potentially summon to or from them if they are within range of his network. This is very useful for tracking targets. The way these anchors actually function is by using density and gravity magic to form incredibly tiny black holes out of compressed [[Aura]], and using the infinitesimal wormhole projected from them to *literally reduce the distance* between one node and another, allowing him to do magic across the network. These wormholes are so small that it would be impossible to send anything other than [[Aura]] through them. At least, for now.

His primary summoning tools are a "force" style levitate, and ~~having a pocket dimension.~~ (this pocket dimension this is not really true anymore, at least at early levels) He uses a wrist mounted device to help him hold open his portal to his pocket dimension, but he can do it without the device with more effort.

His Boost magic almost all has to do with energy/mass density. Making things heavy, light, dense, etc. are all in his wheelhouse. A move he uses frequently is to increase the inertia of an attack as it is moving.

His summoning and boost magic can be combined in specific situations to create a region where time moves more slowly due to the condensed energy in that space, but due to his limitations he almost requires equipment set up in advance to do this in any meaningful way.

His summoning/augmentation combo also allows him to interrogate and imbue items with aura. This is mostly a non-combat skill, and is the basis of his job's work.
## Telekinetics
I like the idea of using [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/smYlhDK-P4o?si=UiJn0UydjKUme9mi) as his mechanism for levitating objects, because it is inherently short range. Both magnetism and gravity have serious falloff. [This](https://youtu.be/V5FyFvgxUhE?si=kMVYgxB0NJWjVBR5) is a fairly good demonstration of spinning magnet levitation. [One more video](https://youtube.com/shorts/MBOukGr_yAg?si=UeUnw2oLh78nASlX)

I like the idea of expanding his magic into all fundamental forces, which would include magnetism, and that his “summoning” is almost entirely restricted to [[Aura]], energy, and information. He uses [[Summoning]], but he is abusing [[Augmentation]] in order to emulate types of [[Summoning]] that he cannot yet do intuitively.

## Slowing Down Time
I think a way he might be able to slow down time in a specific spot at a distance is by having an array of locations (his anchors) that produce [gravitational waves by orbiting pairs of singularities](https://youtube.com/shorts/HY11Rxnbb8E?si=1rxlErOZ8AnS9mX0), where the waves constructively interfere at a specific spot. The effects of each anchor would me minute, but only when amplified together would they significantly slow down time. I think.

This needs a lot of work.
## Time Stop (D&D style)
I’d like a way for him to *accelerate* time in a local area to allow his party to plan and prep when faced with a variety of situations, but I am struggling to find a way to make it work. I would need “negative mass” or “negative energy” to do it.

I might be able to make something work where I create a zone using some sort of portal that replaces space nearby with *nothing?* And then the nothing is proportionally less massive than being on the planet? But that seems like a massive stretch.

## Summoning as Dimensional Manipulation
Traditionally summoning is thought of as manipulating an objects position in space, or by manipulating the shape of space itself. But what if what we call “summoning” can actually be applied to *all dimensions,* including time. In the same way that we can bend space and move an object along spacelike dimensions, we might also be able to move an object along time as a dimension as well.

In the same way that summoning does not stop gravity from affecting objects, the “force“ that pulls objects through time still needs to be resisted. The flow of time is always forward, so at most you could resist the flow of time, but likely never actually go backwards.

There are two types of spatial summing: “telekinetics” where you can hold an object in space and move it around, and “teleportation” where it changes location “instantly.” In spatial summoning teleportation is possible because there are 3 spatial dimensions to manipulate, and so the curvature of spacetime can be warped into non-Euclidean ways. In *temporal* summoning, there is only a single dimension, so you do not have the same freedom to warp the timeline and form connections where they do not already exist. The flow and direction of time is basically immutable and there is nowhere else to divert it to. Therefore, direct time travel is not possible in the same way that direct summoning is, however classical time acceleration *is* possible in the same way that telekinesis is possible.
## Core Ability Rework
I write a little bit in [[An Offer You Can't Refuse]] about issues with the way I've described [[Aster Kenos]]'s magic. Based on these issues, I think I'm going to have to change the way he is doing time fields away from a gravity exploit, and towards dimensional manipulation using time as a dimension. If I rework him like this, then I think I am going to basically give him access to fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force). This is also thematic for him, because all of these forces have exponential falloff over distance, just like he does.

His core abilities would then be:
- [[Augmentation]]: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force
- [[Summoning]]: [[Aura]] transfer, dimensional bending (primarily time).
## Special Moves and Team-Ups
### Lorentz Cascade
This is a team-up move with [[Tobi]]. The premise is that [[Aster Kenos]] can use time manipulation to cause some source of [[Aura]], such as the giant gem in [[Sev’reon]], to speed up. This increases it's local [[Aura]] output, which he can then absorb and channel into even stronger time dilation, using it as a cascading feedback loop to get more and more and more energy per second. He then channels this insane amount of energy to [[Tobi]], whom he *also* accelerates through time. Accelerating her allows her to channel [[Aura]] at a safe rate, because from her perspective she is receiving it more slowly because her time is moving fast, which allows her to channel [[Aura]] into a continuous attack at rates that would normally be impossible without severe [[Aura Poisoning]].

This would allow someone like [[Tobi]] to fire a Kaiju annihilating beam for as long as [[Aster Kenos]] can maintain the bridge. It is [[Aster Kenos]]'s ultimate "world ending" trump card, and if he is ever forced to use it, it would almost certainly kill him.

I imagine that he can only do this somewhere like [[Sev’reon]] where he has access to a massive source of [[Aura]]. I also think that he would call [[Sev’erna]] to shut down the city's power draw while he does it, to prevent damage to the crystal.

There is *one* scenario where he doesn't die, and that is *only* if he can achieve [[Super Sayin Transformation]] mode and "freely" channel [[Aura]] without evaporating himself.
### Lorentz Cradle
(Change the name)
Imagine a newton’s cradle, except that every ball is slowed down to a lesser rate of time. The force per second of each impact should in theory be higher with each stage. This is the railgun equivalent of hitting a nail with a hammer. The gun’s hammer itself *is* the propulsion.
### The Boogie-Woogie
[[Aster Kenos]] and [[Daz]] can basically do the boogie woogie from JJK, where [[Daz]] swaps their places to confuse the enemy and [[Aster Kenos]] uses augmented punches to just armor break right through big targets.
# Relationships
## [[Daz]]
Aster and Daz met prior to daz leaving [[Sev’reon]] to search for the [[Swalescape]], and became friends. They apparently play the [[DDC Version of MTG Concept]], whatever that is.

# Physical Appearance
Height: 5'11"
# Theories and Research
I think Aster doesn’t fully agree with the established understanding of the nature of Aura and Magic.

I think at some level he believes that magic is a single fundamental force, and that all types of magic are the same. One reason he believes this is because it is understood that [[Great Spirit]] are capable of using all 4 quadrants of magic, and so he thinks that there is no reason why humanity would only be limited to only a subset of types. There is no understood mechanism for *why* humanity is limited. He suggests that we simply are not. I also think that he believes that all magic requires [[Summoning]], and that [[Summoning]] might be the only true type of magic there is. For example: [[Manifestation]] is simply using summoning to hold aura in 3D space without a vessel. [[Manifestation]] may just be a subset of summoning rather than it’s own quadrant.
# Death
There is now way [[Aster Kenos]] dies in any way other that from [[Aura Poisoning]]. Even if he suffers a deadly wound, he’s going to be burning as much [[Aura]] as fast as possible to slow time for himself until *someone* can save him.
