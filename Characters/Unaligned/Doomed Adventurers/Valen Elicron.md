(Previously Veil in older writing)
Goes by Vale as a shortened nickname.
# Aliases
Veil has 3 main aliases: his true self (which he uses in avon’s group who all die), the war mage [[Weltzer]] coerced by [[Chernabog]], and a third name when he is interacting with [[Kuno]]/generally not being terrible.

He obviously starts his life using his default look, but decided to use an alias when he became an adventurer along with [[Rena]] to avoid scrutiny and suspicion (the details on why he felt the need to do this are undecided). While adventuring with Avon he disguises his form but uses his real name, because his heritage is the thing he was hiding. Eventually that group dies (likely due to a choice Veil made) and he eventually ends up with Xion’s group, likely still using the same alias and name, this time using Avon’s crystal sword. He uses that sword as his primary weapon for a time, but at some point he loses the crystal sword and instead gains the gold Gryphon claw sword and shield, and then his bad luck continues and he is separated from xion as well. At this point he starts to go solo as weltzer (which includes a new look), and eventually falls into the influence of Chernabog. During his campaign he interacts with [[Kuno]], but he uses his true self and his gold sword and shield when in her presence. After Kuno’s death and his “resurrection” he returns to his true self permanently.

I will need to keep careful track of whether or not Avon knows who Veil and Weltzer are because his sword can see through illusions.
