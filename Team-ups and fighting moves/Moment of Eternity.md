This is a support move that [[Aster Kenos]] developed in order to enable much higher burst damage than would otherwise be safe or possible for a single person. Fundamentally it's just haste, but it's haste pushed to an extreme degree for a relatively short amount of time. This causes the target to experience more time than others do per second of real time, which means that they can channel that much more [[Aura]] per real world second, which means they don't have to risk [[Aura Poisoning]].

The nature of this technique means that it's application will be different depending on who is being accelerated. Each combo of people has a different named attack:
- [[Aster Kenos]]/[[Tobi]]: [[Moment of Eternity - Lorentz Cascade]]
-
