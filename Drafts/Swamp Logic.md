# Outline
- Start with daz saying "Aster, I can feel you squinting at me..." even though Daz can't see aster behind him (Jawaku probably told him lol)
- Complain about humidity in the swamp, but also why isn't Daz sweating
- Daz says "I guess you just aren't hot enough"
- Aster is like WTF does that even mean
- Akela is like no that actually makes sense because moisture condenses on stuff that is cooler than the air is
- Aster is like WTF am I supposed to do then, jog in circles? Channel Aura perpetually to raise my body temperature?
- Toby is just chilling in Jawaku's back or something and is like "If you're such a genius, why is your first strategy for everything just pure brute force?"
- Someone else is like "Yeah, what is up with that? lol"
- Eventually Daz is like "Why do you think my armor and cloak is black?"
- Aster is like "WTF, no, there is no way" lol
- Someone like Akela is like "No, no he has a point. Darker colors absorb m-"
- And Aster interrupts him like "Yes, I understand the physics, I just refuse to believe our fashion edge-lord over here is wearing black for some practical reason instead of to look cool"
- Daz probably "It can be both."
- Something about being hot = sweating = more heat insulation
- Response saying that's why breathable clothes on skin is better than bare skin: It wicks the moisture away
- Joke about well then why is Jawaku, who is the hottest member of the group, over there *steaming,* and probbaly Kaito is like "You are asking why all the moisture is literally vaporizing off of the hot one? I feel like that question answers itself"
- Aster is like "I'm tired of you all, I shouldn't have said anything" lol

- The Kaito line I had forgotten about was "Maybe you should try dehydrating yourself" in response to the argument that heat makes you sweat which makes you insulated which makes you hot.
