This is just a rough idea for a potential story, and likely conflicts with existing lore. It is experimental.

This event follows soon after the draft I wrote a long time ago about [[Valen Elicron]] complaining to [[Rena]] about being treated differently for being a mage.

The [[Doomed Adventurers]] are responding to a tip about something that fell from the sky not far from some town, and they find that a something formed a crater and punched a hole down into the [[Underdark]]. [[Dark Aura]] is likely corrupting the area inside the crater, coming up from the hole. They go down into the dark, looking for whatever is causing it. They find some sort of object or meteor with the [[Dark Aura]], and they initiate the disaster that kills the party.

A mage interacts with the object and is almost instantly struck by the [[Thought Bomb]] effect, which explodes out from them and affects a wider area. [[Tane's Sister]] is wearing [[Rena's Amulet]] (she has yet to give it to [[Rena]]) which protects her from the negative effects but expends most of her [[Aura]]. At some point something physical happens that A) collapses the cave system, and B) seriously injures [[Rena]]. Iâ€™m imagining that maybe the meteor explodes sending out fragments like a grenade, which also releases the [[Dark Aura]].

[[Tane's Sister]] gives [[Rena]] [[Rena's Amulet]] since she is dying, [[Valen Elicron]] is infected with the [[Dark Aura]], and most of the group dies.
# Why Are They There?
Maybe the person who becomes [[Chernabog]] "hires" them to go investigate something with him and protect him, but in reality his plan is always for this group of mages to be the first ones to die.
# What Do They Find?
Maybe there is an ancient impact crater, but it is so old that it predates most of civilization and the actual meteor is gone. People presumed that it was destroyed, but maybe the meteor, or a chunk of it, actually penetrated down into the [[Underdark]] and has been there for thousands of years. Over time the impact crater has sunken in and the opening has collapsed in on itself preventing anyone from finding the meteor.
# Magic Suppression
Maybe this meteor has to do with why the area around [[Aeolia]] is not magical, and maybe it's removal has to do with the gradual awakening of magic after the [[Dark Aura]] saga. This idea has a lot of issues, primarily because all of the members of [[WUC]] are too old and have been magic users for too long for this to be the truth.
