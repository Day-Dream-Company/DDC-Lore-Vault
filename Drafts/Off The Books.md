# Outline
[[Aster Kenos]] (and maybe [[Daz]]) manage to get into some secure location where secret documents on research projects are kept in [[Sev’reon]], and they are looking for anything about the supposed [[Dark Aura Project]] or anything related to the [[Keywords/Magic/Dark Aura]]gic/Dark Aura]]. They are interrupted and caught by [[Sev’erna]] herself, and when [[Aster Kenos]] tries to slow down time for her so they can make an escape, she uses her mastery of raw [[Summoning]] magic to redirect the location of his own magic onto himself. From [[Aster Kenos]]’s perspective he is surrounded and locked down in a split second, when in reality [[Sev’erna]] has calmly called some of her retainers (likely [[Donovan]] because his [[Aura]] replacement magic is a very powerful counter for an inventive and unpredictable mage like [[Aster Kenos]]) assist her.

It’s unclear what daz does, but it depends on if he is even there, I guess.
