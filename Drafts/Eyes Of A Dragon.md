This contains a section where [[Valen Elicron]] and [[Kuno]] talk (post [[Kunoâ€™s Death]]), and a section where they fight [[Daz]] and [[Jawaku]]. The fight is not cannon because it was written back when [[WUC]] and DDC were seperated by a lot more time. Since then they have been moved to run more in parallel.
