# Summary
[[Rena]] goes to recover the [[Crystal Sword]] for herself, and meets [[Kuno]] who is it's current owner. They fight over it, and ultimately [[Kuno]] wins, or at least she would have killed [[Rena]] if not for [[Rena's Amulet]]. [[Kuno]] realizes what [[Rena's Amulet]] does, and in a moment of compassion [[Rena]] allows her to try to get it to draw from [[Kuno]]'s [[Aura]]. It doesn't work, and [[Kuno]] looses a significant chunk of resolve, simply giving up the sword. [[Rena]] offers her a place in [[WUC]], hoping that maybe as a group they can figure out a way to help her recover her magic.

# How Do They Know [[Kuno]]'s Location
On one hand, I think [[Kuno]] sort of wants to be found. She wants to fight people, she wants to push the [[Crystal Sword]] to do something or she wants to die and be done.
On the other, [[Kuno]] will have gone to the same place she and [[Valen Elicron]] go in [[Eyes Of A Dragon]] because that is one of the places she goes when she wants to escape from the world.
# Sword Choreography
## [[Kuno]]’s Stance
[This video](https://youtu.be/DvfbHe_xnVM?t=86) shows as close an example to [[Kuno]]'s counterattack. In the video they go for a sliding stab along the opponent's blade keeping them on the outside, but in the demo the first attacker just stands there and does nothing. In [[Rena]]'s case she would need to rotate her guard and lift up with the back edge of the blade.

## [[Rena]]’s Stance
I think I’m imagining [[Rena]] starting with the Archer’s Guard (shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/ibWNxM9Q7Ro?si=DophfoYtn0Wr5Q6h)). The
Is guard more definitely uses 2 hands though, and I’m not sure how hard I want her to vomit to using a one handed strategy. It kinda doesn’t make a lot of sense to use one hand without a good reason, and you can always let go with one if you need to.
