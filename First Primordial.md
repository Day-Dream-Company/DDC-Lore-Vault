The [[First Primordial]] was the largest of all beings and therefore is a significant source of [[Aura]] as well as produced it’s own [[Magic]]al framework. It’s effects are not felt strongly on [[Pernicion]], however, because of The vast distance between it and the [[Third Primordial]] orbiting out at the edge of the [[Ring Nebula]]. It’s [[Magic]] does have some small effect on [[Pernicion]], though, because of the [[Nova Shard]] at its core.
