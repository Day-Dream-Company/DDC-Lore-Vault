This is the Sky Kingdom, where [[Tobi]] is from. This place has a sort of wild and unpredictable aura inherent to it. It's not clear yet whether there are floating solid islands up there, or if it's magic that makes the clouds solid, or what.

Tobi is toying with the idea of having some really high mountains form pillars of floating rocks that go high enough that they reach the sky kingdom. If you wanted to, you could climb the rocks and vines and stuff to reach it, though with the advancement of magic and technology getting there is much easier.

[[Tobi's Mom]] also plays a big role in it's creation as this is her domain.
