The capital and first city on [[Aeolia]]

Name Ideas:
- Aeolus (Lots of greek reference that all have to do with wind)

# Drinking Water
They probably have a system where they collect and condense the leftover steam that powers their city into drinkable water. This would allow them to use salt water in all of their industry and then collect the distilled water afterwards to reuse it for drinking.
# Elevators
Each elevator has a counterweight on the other end of a pulley, so the force required to lift it only really needs to overcome the friction of the rope and pulley. When a load is put into the elevator it compresses a spring system that measures the weight, and an elevator operator will remove ballast water from a tank on the elevator platform until the scale returns to the neutral position. Then the platform is unclamped and pumps can turn the pulley and move the elevator. The platform arrives at it’s destination (again, controlled by an operator who can read the current position of the platform based on some kind of dial linked to the pulley wheel), gets locked into the scale, the load is removed, and water is pumped in back to neutral.

## Design Benefits
- The platform cannot be disengaged without being in the neutral position, which ensures you do not overload the elevator.
- In order to counter the load, you must *remove water* from the platform, meaning it is impossible to operate the platform of it is overloaded (because you would not have the water available to remove to zero the scale. You would have to add weight to the other side of the pulley, which is not accessible without taking the elevator offline).
- The ballast is water, so it can be taken on and off in any combination of stops to any degree. If it were metal plates then you would need to have extras stationed at each floor and you would eventually have to take the elevator offline in order to somehow load balance the reserve weights.
## Potential Flaws
- A water leak would suddenly make the system unbalanced, which is obviously not ideal.
	- In the event of an uncontrolled descent, the operator would pull an emergency lever which would engage the locking mechanisms at every floor. The elevator would fall no more than one floor after the emergency is pulled, and would A) land on the spring loaded scale, and B) instantly lock in place. I assume there would be a similar mechanism for the other side, but that would be less dangerous if it fell. It would be really bad, but no one would be hurt because no one should be in there basically ever.
	- The emergency stop should also include a traditional centrifugal clutch like real elevators have, and that clutch should probably be able to activate the emergency stop automatically.
# Lighting
I think they have gas lighting indoors. Flammable gas is actually able to be extracted from things like coal, so a mining and industrial society like [[Aeolia]] realistically should have the technology for gas plumbing.
