[[Sev’reon]] is the capital of [[Sev’ren]], located at the top of [[That Floating Mountain]].
# The Magic Gem
We are toying with the idea that the floating mass at the top of the mountain is actually a floating chunk of rock from [[Neamhríocht]], dragged down and anchored to [[The Planet]].

Check with Daz and Tobi and see what they think about [[Sev'reon's Gem]] being the leftover soul husk thing of a long dead ancient [[Great Spirit]]. That would be kind of hype to one day hear it speak like the traveler in destiny.
