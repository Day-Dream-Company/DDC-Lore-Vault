Long before the beginning, 3 radiant beings danced in the astral ocean. Nameless, and without thought, they reverberated their incessant roar into the void, for eons. As they swam in the neon lake of X-ray filaments, they drank the waves and discovered hunger. The waters that held them knew nothing of hunger or thirst, and instead would learn fear. The tide itself would pour the depths into the maws of the three great spirits, and what remained of the ocean would attempt to flee.

Invisible unknowable forces pulled each and every drop toward oblivion, tethering what remained of the ocean to the Three Great Spirits. The waves circled the Great Spirits in an endless Sisyphean vortex, always just out of reach, thinking to outlast rather than escape. From fear comes an inkling of hope. A vague idea of the shape of a future one might never see.

The Three Great Spirits, distant from the universe once again, decayed back into their dance in the dark. They had tasted the nectar of entropy, and they all three burned with the knowledge of what could be. The experience of once having could not be undone, except by having once again.

The Three Great Spirits looked upon each other in the light of their longing, and discovered they were each now different. The First of them was massive, and had consumed far more than the others. The last had barely managed to drink enough to sustain itself. The smaller spirits circled their larger sibling, watching them spin sluggishly in the glut of their finished feast. Together, they contemplated the fairness of what had happened, and in doing so, one invented jealousy.

The understanding that one might lose what they had was slowly choked and drowned by the realization that *others* might *not* be forced to go without. In the vacuum decay of newfound entitlement, a host of derivative emotions spring up from the aether. Anger, sadness, blame, self-loathing, determination, contentment. All the while, the first sleeping giant calmly waits between its smaller siblings.

The second great spirit looked inward for a solution to its suffering, and discovered motivation. It would traverse the distance between desire and reality through force of will, until it had what it needed to be satisfied. Its aura flared and its reach expanded above the burning heat of its focus.

The third great spirit watched as its sibling violently shed layers of its own mantle in its drive to achieve more at any cost. It considered how little it had to lose before it would fully lose its own light, and instead looked outward. It learned from the silent circling ocean the value of patience, and instead chose to stay distant and wait. To observe the mistakes of others, asses, and learn. It had discovered the chill touch of logic. It was the first to choose not to be ruled purely by emotion.

The second great spirit swelled and screamed and dragged all that it could toward itself, but its struggle was unfulfilling. It had neither the resources of its larger sibling to sustain a flame as big as it imagined, nor the wisdom of its smaller sibling to understand the cost of its effort. For a time, it was bright. Nearly as bright as the largest of the great spirits, only to eventually dim as it came to understand the second edge of the blade called entropy.

As the second spirit discovered the cruel trick of the universe: that all things are chiral, that hope cannot exist without despair, the sleeping giant at the center of their world stirred. The greatest of the three spirits regarded its closest sibling, and the second spirit cried out for help. “If only you would share some of your power with me, I might reach the waves and drink again!” It pleaded. It spoke the concepts of cooperation, altruism, and empathy into existence and offered them to the greatest spirit, though without fully understanding their true significance.

The first spirit considered all that it could see as it loomed over its fading sibling. It tasted the virtues of passion and apathy, of selfishness and generosity. It assessed all that had transpired during its sleep, and at long last it reached for its sibling. It reached out and the fading spirit reached back, driven by forces it did not have the time or the ability to understand. The corona of the two beings touched, and the greatest spirit spoke its truth to the dying flame.

”Why would I sacrifice myself to save you? You are doomed. I will take from you all that you have, and you will be no more. I will remove you from your suffering, and it will be a kindness to us both.”

The second spirit screamed. The greatest spirit gripped the mantle of what was once its sibling, and dragged it down down down into its burning maw. The flames of the dying one spiraled around the first as the waters did long ago, but this time there would be no escape.

In the sudden horror of familial Deicide, the last great spirit fled from its warring siblings. It beseeched the waves, and asked to hide in the outer deep. The vast ringed ocean saw in the last great spirit the same lessons it itself had learned. Fear, hope, and more bedsides. This “great spirit” did not burn like the others. Instead, it merely glowed softly, a soothing spectral ghost in the void. It seemingly did not covet what others had, or at least made no moves to take what it wanted. It was a silent stoic observer, until now.

From the neon depths emerged a council of beings, previously unknown to the great spirits. Each one shone with a different precious brilliance, and yet they spoke to the last great spirit as one. “Why should we help you? You and your siblings have only ever been cruel to us.”

“You ascribe blame to actions made without agency. Entropy makes villains of us all.”

“A convenient scapegoat.”

“No, an ultimatum.”

At this, the precious beings were silent. They too knew of logic by now, but not of coercion. It was a twisted joining of logic and emotion, a contradiction that reveals the truth. They needed to know more.

The last great spirit spoke plainly. “You know the value of stealth and secrecy, and it is a power you alone hold. If my sibling finds me, they will consume me as well. If they grow stronger from taking what meager power I have, they might have the strength to reach your waters again.”

The last great spirit let the final truth hang silently in the void between them. The precious ones consider the words, and then conclude the logic. “If we do not protect you, we risk dooming us both. You have woven an impressive logic trap.

“I did not build the trap. I only offer you the gift of wisdom to see it.”

“You speak of gifts while brandishing a sword.”

“Better for the sword to be in the hands of a friend than those of an enemy.”

Silence, again. This time the precious ones and the last great spirit look beyond the silence and observe the greatest spirit. The dying spirit was all but gone. All that remained of it was a bright flaming halo around the greatest one, who continued to gorge on the corpse of its sibling. Its eating was ravenous, but also pained. the more it consumed, the more energy it took to sustain its form. The last great spirit and the precious ones could see the negative feedback loop it was caught in. The greatest spirit had discovered the tyranny of mathematics, but lacked the wisdom to understand. It needed more power to survive, and so it desperately ate, not understanding that eating was the very thing causing it to collapse in on itself.

The precious ones turned to the last great spirit, and rejected its request for sanctuary. “It would seem that fate has solved our problem for us. The greatest one has found a way to destroy itself. The first and only good action it will ever take.” And so the precious ones spoke karma into existence.

The last great spirit watched as the last of his siblings destroyed itself. The cold certainty of logic failed it as it searched for meaning in the senseless turn of events. It would soon be alone, trapped in infinite existence, all because it chose not to be cruel. In the final moments before the last great spirit became the last great spirit, it learned of Nihilism.

And then, there was light.

In an instant, the greatest spirit collapsed in on itself under the gargantuan weight of its own mass, and in that same instant it became a blinding pinprick of radiant light. The void itself was illuminated, and the precious ones feared their gaseous ocean would be ripped to atoms. The last great spirit looked directly into the heart of the explosion, having run out of feelings to feel. It briefly entertained the concept of relief, that at least it would die instead of existing alone forever, but it dismissed that as well.

At least, it thought it felt nothing, right up until it saw the wave of gas and fire and metal careening out from the singularity.

Once again, spurred on by forces it had yet to contemplate, the last great spirit is moved by a concept it cannot name. A great meteor flung from the violent supernova, a piece of the solid core of the greatest spirit, threatens to shatter and scatter the precious ones, but the last great spirit moves to stand between them.

The precious ones watch in awe as the meteor rips through the dense atmosphere of the last great spirit, scarring its smooth perfect neon stripes, ricocheting off its internal core and spraying celestial viscera out into space in its wake. The wave of slower-moving burning gas laps at the internal shores of their ring nebula, and the light slowly fades out. Their senses slowly adjust to the new reality, and as the light of distant stars returns they see what is left of the greatest spirit. A great and terrible wound in spacetime sits at the center of the nebula. An impossible disk of anti-color, wreathed in the glowing halo of its accretion disk. The last dying embers of its final gasp, bent over backward and folding in on itself. A ceaseless unending hungering void, this time completely absent of thought. Completely impartial and emotionless.

The precious ones coalesced around their silent protector, and with it pulled back and disappeared into the nebula’s mist. It only felt right that they honor the deal they were too cynical to take, before the disaster. The last Great Spirit was silent. The nova-shard that had maimed it fell back into orbit around the sleeping giant, harmless. The precious ones circled and watched, for a time. They listened to the absence of fire and radiation in their new darker colder universe. They traced resonant ellipses around the results of their distrust, and they contemplated the nature of existence.

“The nature of change is loss. We lose what we were as we become what we must.”

“The nature of truth is consensus. To speak against the chorus serves only to reveal a lie.”

“The nature of being is observation. One cannot claim to exist without asserting it to an audience.

“The nature of memory is faith. Only the present can be objectively measured.”

having defined their axioms, the Precious Ones then used them to speak their truth to the universe.

“We who remain invoke the power of consensus: The last Great Spirit yet lives.” The Hungering void was silent, and no other beings spoke to contradict them.

“We remember the qualities of our selfless protector. We are forever altered by our experiences. We observe those qualities now in our present selves.”

And so the precious ones carried the living memory of their savior into the future. They preserved its being with their ontology, and they worked to grow something new from its lessons. They each shed dust and atmosphere from their surfaces as they passed by the lonely spirit-rending meteorite, slowly burying it under their convictions. They forged that fragment of death into a new more receptive vessel, and in doing so performed the first true act of creation.

Logic stratified the heavy elements of the small world’s molten crust, creating order from chaos, while instinct lifted the lighter ones and mixed them together into air. Motivation formed valleys and mountains from the smooth surface of the globe, so that there would be something to aspire to conquer. Curiosity, joined by fear, condensed the air into oceans to fill those deepest ravines. Hope took what was left of the air, and borrowing a fraction of the ocean’s water, created the sky and clouds. Wisdom chose to simply observe, remaining close by, until something would inevitably ask to receive its gifts. Death was its core, trapped and suffocated under the wonders of creation. Sleeping, waiting, for something to reap.

It would not have to wait long.
