This is an excerpt from [[Recruiting Kuno]] about the construction of the [[TRS]].
# We All Lift
I heavily associate [We All Lift Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIELWjG8Tc) from Warframe with this story. I have always loved the song from the first moment I heard it, the parts about air and water flowing are 100% on point, it's heavily industrial, it talks about generational responsibility for fixing mistakes, the idea that the fate of everyone is tied together fits the way Is structured the [[Fold]]s and [[Manifold]], and the repeating "Together" is just the perfect keystone for how I wrote the first [[TRS]] message to be transmitted.
# Narrated Version
## Music
I'm considering using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDp2lQOuzxk) as background music for my narration, though this is a little too heroic and slow.
