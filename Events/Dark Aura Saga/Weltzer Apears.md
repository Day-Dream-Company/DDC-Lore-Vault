When [[Valen Elicron]] makes his first big move as [[Weltzer]], he is waiting in a tavern at a tiny village on the border for a magic user to come by. He has been given information by [[Chernabog]] and instructed to intercept this magic user, subdue and corrupt them, end ensure there are no witnesses. When the adventurer comes by, [[Valen Elicron]] learns that it is none other than [[Tane's Sister]]. He is shocked to learn that she is alive. He is highly conflicted because he is obviously happy she is alive, but also betrayed that she seemingly abandoned him, and pissed that he’s being made to betray her now.

One way or another, he fights her. She learns who he is, and he is able to force the [[Keywords/Magic/Dark Aura]]gic/Dark Aura]] on her. He is also forced to clean up any witnesses who saw the fight. He really doesn’t want to just kill a bunch of innocent people so he argues with [[Chernabog]] for an alternative. The only other option is to infect and take them as well, and then make arrangements to cover up why a bunch of people in a teeny tiny village are suddenly missing overnight, which he begrudgingly does with the promise that they will not be killed.
