I like the idea that this used to belong to Iayâ€™s sister, and it came into [[Rena]] Poseidon burring the event that killed the group. [[Rena]] is seriously injured, she gives her the amulet and maybe an [[Aura Reserve]] to keep her going, and it is able to keep her alive with a stab wound or something until he can escape and find help.

It would make sense for her to have it because she is the most skilled mage in the group and a seasoned adventurer. She has the [[Magic]]al endurance to really make use of it, and it allows her to sort of tank at the same time as she focuses on supporting others. Her [[Dynamic]] might even be useful to shield others via the amulet alone, like maybe in the scene with the dragon fire.
