# Construction and Design
## Recoil Compensation
In real life high precision bows have a weight at the front of the bow to make it balanced while at full draw, but when the archer releases the arrow the bow's center of gravity shifts forward and the bow tilts down. This is probably fine if  the arrow has gotten most of it's energy already, but I don't like it.

This bow will have an *active recoil compensation system* which also might contribute to total draw weight. Effectively, there will be secondary strings on the *front* of the bow arms that pull on something when the bow arms are drawn back. These strings will pull on and unwind a coiled spring, which will move a weight on the bow forward as the competition bows have. Then, as the arrow is released, the spring loaded counterweight will help pull the arms forward and compensate for the change in the bow's center of gravity.
## Multiple Strings
This bow has a total of 5 strings
