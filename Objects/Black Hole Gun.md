[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) says that a black hole the mass of a car would be 10^-24 m, would evaporate in less than a nanosecond, and would have a luminosity 200 times brighter than the sun. A black hole the mass of our sun would have a temperature of 62 nanokelvins which is much lower than the 2.7 Kelvin if the cosmic microwave background, so it would not evaporate because it reduces more energy than it gives off. In order to exceed the temperature of the CMB and evaporate, a black hole would have to be about the mass of the moon which would mean it would have a diameter of less than 1/10th of a millimeter. I assume it would also be dark, since the CMB is dark to us.

The ideal size is somewhere between moon and car. I would want it to be bright enough that it can be a flashy beam, but not so bright that itâ€™s blinding like looking into the sun, which means it would be larger than car mass.
