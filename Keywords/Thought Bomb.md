This needs a more cannon name, but in DDC the concept would refer to some kind of device or power that creates a blast that only damaged things that use magic. This is a potential weapon that [[Chernabog]] might use in his mission against magic users.

We are leaning towards an effect like the extremis program in iron man 3, where a person infected with enough [[Dark Aura]] who is weak of mind will create an explosion of potentially cascading energy and leave behind a [[Wire-men]] in their place. Strong willed people like [[Valen Elicron]] and [[Kaito]] can remain affected by the [[Dark Aura]] without exploding, though if their resolve fails they could still cascade at any time.
