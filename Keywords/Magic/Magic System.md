A complete, comprehensive, and non-convoluted guide to the DDC magic system.

# What *Is* Magic?
The use of one's [[Aura]] to perform a spell | or magical effect.
(Can be affected by the caster's ability to concentrate)
Divided into arcane and divine categories. Typically a humanoid can tap into 1 or 2 of the quadrants of arcane magic but some have been known to utilize minor effects from a third.
## What Is A Spell?
A feat or effect caused by the use of magic requiring the user to expend aura.
Some spells or effects require the combined use of 3 or more quadrant's minor effects. These spells are possible by humanoids but require specific training and study.
(does this mean that the limit is *being capable* of using more than 2 quadrants, or using 3-4 *at the same time?*)
## What Is [[Aura]]?
The externalization of the soul of a living creature, and the power source of magic and magical effects. Auras are represented by their Dynamic and their color.
(Include Aura's limited use day-to-day, aura burn, and corruption)
(Can be effected by emotional state and other magical effects)
## What Is Arcane Magic?
Arcane magic is magic intrinsic to humanoids that isn't sourced or enhanced by a divine being, location, or phenomenon. It's divided into 4 sub-categories. [[Summoning]], Alchemy, Augmentation, and Manifestation.
(Are the quadrants of magic set in stone? Or can they be changed later in life?)
