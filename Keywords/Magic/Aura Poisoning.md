(Also called Aura Burn or Mana Burn)

Aura poisoning is something that happens in all situations where aura is moved around or converted into effects. Whether a living being is channeling aura to cast magic, or aura is being moved from one crystal reserve to another, the transfer of magic does damage over time to the medium that contains it.

In humans this damage manifests as:
- Pain
- Physical damage to your body
- Reduced maximum mana capacity
- Reduced aura conversion efficiency
- In extreme cases, death

The damage caused by Aura Poisoning is generally permanent, but can be reduced over time depending on the nature and severity of the damage. In cases of severe life threatening damage, a 100% recovery is often impossible, but with fast treatment and enough time and luck it is possible to make a partial recovery. In minor cases, a full recovery is often possible, where any long lasting side effects, if any, are inconveniences rather than chronic injuries. It can be similar to how a broken bone can regain most of its full structural function, but might still occasionally ache in response to changes in weather or air pressure, or how your skin will form scar tissue that is only a cosmetic defect.

The damage done by Aura Poisoning is often localized to the part of the body the person is channeling magic from. As an example: [[Tobi]] will apparently eventually lose her sight due to Aura Poisoning from shooting lighting out of here eyes in a risky battle, because she is channeling her aura directly through her eyes.
