Daz wants to do a sort of Super Sayin style transformation where you are able to draw on external aura as opposed to your own personal internal aura.

The transformation is unique to each location, but each location is consistent in what it’s effect is. For example, the [[Neamhríocht]] might make you grow [[Orichalcum]] spikes from your fingernails or horns if you have them.
