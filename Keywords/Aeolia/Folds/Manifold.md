A collection of [[Fold]]s who have chosen to unite in order to pool and better distribute their resources. The point of a [[Manifold]] is the same as having a [[Fold]] in the first place, and the same reason why modern insurance is useful (in theory): you can collect excess resources from those that have too much and give it to those who need it. The more people in the system, the more likely you will be able to distribute things comfortably. Collecting multiple [[Fold]]s into one body gives them even more leverage in the [[Guild Council]], but allows for more efficient decision making and voting since the [[Manifold]] is really only a few entities.
