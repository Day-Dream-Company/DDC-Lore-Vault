The equivalent to the US House of Representatives.
# Speaker Of The House
There should be someone at the very top of this government structure, like a prime minister or a president, who is the ultimate authority when it comes to [[Fold]] disputes. This role must be unanimously elected by all [[Manifold]] members, and if there is no one in the role then the entire government system collapses. This way, the [[Fold]]s are *forced* to cooperate and elect someone who will fairly represent all members.

The role of this leader is purely for mediation and punishment of the [[Manifold]] members. They do not make any laws and they follow a strict set of rules for how to govern. They are effectively a formality to ensure no one is cheating, as the role could theoretically be automated or the [[Fold]]s could self police, but they obviously cannot be trusted to do so because no one can. The only thing they have the power to do is to declare that a situation has arisen where the current laws *do not address the situation,* as in the event of a new technology being developed that the old laws did not consider. They have no power to make laws about the situation or even opine about it, and that process is left to the [[Manifold]] [[Fold]] members themselves somehow.
