This is a special material that is found naturally as a metal, can be forged into different shapes if done carefully, and will turn to a clear material is heated above a certain temperature.

Potentially referred to as Dragon Glass sometimes.

It’s defining feature, besides it’s crystal phase change, is that looking through its glass form makes magic that would otherwise be invisible, visible. Any magic, whether it be an enchantment or the aura of a living creature, is visible as if it were being actively manifested. The strength of the effect depends on the quality of the glass, and is only ever partially transparent like looking at a reflection on clear glass. It is like a sort of overlay of the real world, like looking through an extra transparent layer of reality.

It is possible to hide your aura even from someone looking through dragonglass, but this requires active control and suppression of your aura. It would require a certain amount of discipline and training for a mage to be able to hide their aura well, particularly if they are a powerful mage with a strong aura. Active aura suppression combined with a less than pure dragonglass lens would allow someone’s aura to be completely invisible even when looking through the glass.

The metal is referred to as dragonglass not only because it tends to be found in its crystal form where dragons make their nests, but also because I think dragons should be able to see with this same kind of “true sight” naturally.
