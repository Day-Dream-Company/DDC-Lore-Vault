This is the name of the material used to store [[Aura]] and other enchantments.
The name refers to a [a real life metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orichalcum), but doesn't really share similar physical properties with it. It was translated as "aurichalcum" by Romans, which I kind of like better, personally. I also think something like "orichalite" might sound better and separate it a bit from the more real-life word.

# Magic Populations
The proximity of [[Orichalcum]] near dense humanoid populations causes people to be born with higher magic sensitivity, and where there is very low amounts there are few mages like in [[Aeolia]].
