# Nature
Dragons have massive ego and think that they are better than everyone else, but they are not necessarily selfish.
# Hoarding
Dragons are "magically" sustained by their hoard and can live indefinitely off of the magic generated by it. Dragons can hoard anything and it will sustain them, as long as they collect and protect it.
