# [[Akela Kalani]]'s Ice Transmutation
Sassy recently said to me that he had a conversation with Daz about [[Akela Kalani]] being able to transmute a sword or object into ice if he understands what it's made of. Daz seems to be supportive of this kind of magic.

At first I was hesitant about this kind of power, because it would be immensely powerful, but after thinking about it for longer, I think it actually leads to some interesting worldbuilding results that simultaneously keep it in check and are also just really cool.

The limiting factors should be:
1. Transmutation from one element to another should be harder the more different they are,
2. Transmuting more material, or transmuting it faster, costs more [[Aura]] (typical magic limitations),
3. This is only possible, as Sassy noted, *if you understand what the object is made of.*

The results of these limitations suggest to me two things:
1. If knowing the material is important in order to do the transmutation, then it also follows that knowing the *construction* of the object is equally important. (This follows the logic that Frieren presents: That magic requires complete understanding and visualization over the thing you are manipulating)
2. That if this is a power that is possible, there would be natural defenses against it developed:
	- Making things with varied and complex metallic alloys to make it harder to correctly understand their properties, and
	- Making metal tools/weapons with multiple types of folded layered metal, Damascus style, to effectively double the (already very complex) complexity of the weapon.
It also stands to reason that a transmutation power like this is more efficient/effective when the target is a "pure" and homogenous material in a general sense. It might be effective against metal, or against a type of crystal, but it would not be nearly as effective/would require far more aura to work on something like wood, or even types of glass (since glass is typically an amorphous solid).

These limitations make me happy, because it makes Damascus Steel patterned weapons go from a "cool" fantasy trope with not much functional purpose into a well justified cultural development as a response to magical advancement. The prevalence of Damascus Steel weapons eventually leads to the development of Folded Dragon Glass metal, which might have further interactions. For example, it might be a stronger hybrid material than other diffusion bonded/forge welded materials, and it might also enable object to be more easily enchanted (since they are partially just [[Aura]] gems themselves at that point), but it might also somehow make the Dragon Glass portion of the weapon somehow more susceptible to magic effects including transmutation if they are not enchanted. It might also make them harder to manipulate if they are already enchanted though, so using a [[Mage]]'s abilities to determine the nature of the object continues to be incredibly important and the main limiting factor.
